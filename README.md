# Quadratic Equation Solver
This repository contains several versions of my first ever programming project - a quadratic equation solver.

This program uses the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations. It currently can't handle complex numbers.

## Repository Contents
- `original/` - Contains the first version (2013)
- `equation/` - Contains the most recent version. Has a "Show Working" feature (2016 or so)
- `bootquation/` - Same as `equation`, but uses Bootstrap for styling
- `Eqsolver.html` - One of the earlier versions (2015)
